# Spotify Playlist Insight

A web application that analyzes Spotify playlists and provides detailed genre distribution and statistics. This was a small side project developed for my own interest.

## Features

- Genre distribution visualization with interactive pie and bar charts
- Track filtering by genre
- Release year analysis
- Top artists showcase
- Similar artists discovery
- Genre connections visualization
- One-click genre radio generation

## Usage

1. Visit [Spotify Playlist Insight](https://kleinschock.github.io/SpotifyPlaylistInsight/)
2. Login with your Spotify account
3. Enter a Spotify playlist URL or ID
4. View the comprehensive analysis of your playlist

## Technical Details

- Built with vanilla JavaScript
- Uses Spotify Web API for data retrieval
- Visualizations created with Chart.js
- No server-side components (client-side only)

## Limitations

Some features may be limited due to Spotify API restrictions, but core genre analysis works for all playlists.
